# CaffeReviewer

## About
Project is put on hold. I got carried away tring to learn api, that is not needed here. I will resume work in the far future.

CaffeReviewer is a web application designed to showcase cafes and allow users to rate them. The primary focus of this project is on backend development, ensuring robust functionality and scalability. While the aesthetics of the website are secondary, the backend is built to handle various user interactions, including adding and viewing ratings and comments.

The project draws inspiration from [Laptop Friendly](https://laptopfriendly.co/), which serves as a reference for creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface for showcasing businesses.

- **Caf√© Listings**: Display a list of cafes with essential information including name, location, image and average user's rating.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**: The programming language used to write the backend code.
